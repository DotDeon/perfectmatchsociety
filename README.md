#Perfect Match Society NFT Project

Perfect Match Society was one of my first fullstack NFT projects, and it was a great opportunity for me to learn more about Ethereum blockchain and NFTs. The project was inspired by Doodles x Cool Cats x WGMInterface, and it consisted of a collection of 10,000 randomly generated PMS living on the Ethereum blockchain.

As the sole developer for the project, I was responsible for everything from generating the images and JSON files from assets to writing the smart contract and the front-end. The project required me to learn a lot of new technologies, including Solidity for the smart contract, web3.js for interacting with the Ethereum network, and React for the front-end.

The PMS NFTs were randomly generated and composed of a variety of hand-drawn traits. Users could mint PMS NFTs using Ether, and they could also buy and sell them on the secondary market. The project was a lot of fun to work on, and it was a great way to explore the possibilities of NFTs and the Ethereum blockchain.

However, it's worth noting that the Perfect Match Society site is no longer in use, so the code is available on my GitHub repository for educational purposes only. Despite the project no longer being actively maintained or used, I am still proud of the work I did on it and what I learned during the process.

#Conclusion

Perfect Match Society was a challenging project that allowed me to dive deeper into the world of Ethereum blockchain and NFTs. As the sole developer for the project, I had to learn a lot of new technologies and overcome many challenges along the way. Although the site is no longer in use, I am proud of the work I did on it and the skills I gained during the development process.
